## Project Structure

- **mysite**: The main Django project that provides the overall configuration and settings.
- **job_application**: A Django app within the project, responsible for handling all job application-related features.

## How the Program Works

1. **mysite** acts as the root project, managing global settings, URLs, and configurations.
2. **job_application** is registered within `mysite/settings.py` and its URLs are included in the main `urls.py` file, ensuring seamless integration.
3. The application uses Django's built-in features for routing, form handling, and database management.

## job_application App Functionality

The `job_application` app provides the following features:

- **Job Application Form**: Users can fill out and submit a form with their personal details, resume, and other relevant information.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all required fields are completed and data is valid before submission.
- **Data Storage**: Submitted applications are saved to the database for later review.
- **Admin Interface**: Administrators can view, filter, and manage job applications through Django's admin panel.
- **User Feedback**: Applicants receive confirmation upon successful submission.

## How job_application Aligns with mysite

- The `job_application` app is modular and reusable, plugged into the `mysite` project via Django's app system.
- All URLs and views from `job_application` are accessible through the main project, maintaining a unified user experience.
- The app leverages `mysite`'s settings for authentication, templates, and static files.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:  
    ```bash
    pip3 install django   
    ```
2. **Apply migrations**:  
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
3. **Run the development server**:  
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
4. **Access the app**:  
    Visit `http://localhost:8000/job_application/` in your browser.

## Customization

You can extend the `job_application` app by adding new fields to the form, customizing templates, or integrating with external services as needed.
